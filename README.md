# Whack-A-Mole

![Mole game screenshot]

## Getting started

That starter repository contains the following files:

* **mole-head.png** which contains the image of the mole's head.
* **mole-hill.png** which contains the image of the dirt pile.
* **mole.css** which is the file in which you will write your CSS.
* **mole.html** which is the file in which you will write your HTML.
* **mole.js** which is the file which contains the JavaScript that controls the game.

> Note: In these files, you will add your own HTML and CSS code, and you will
> also be given some code. It is important to leave any commented-out code as-is
> until you are directed to un-comment the code in the instructions.
